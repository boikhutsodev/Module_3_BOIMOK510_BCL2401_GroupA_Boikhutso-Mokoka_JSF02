# Svelte Online Store

This is a simple online store built with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and `svelte-routing`. The store fetches product data from an external API and displays it in a responsive grid. Users can filter and sort products, and view detailed information for each product on a separate page.

## Features

- **Product Grid**: Displays a grid of product cards.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about each product on a separate page.
- **Search**: Search for products by title.
- **Filter**: Filter products by category.
- **Sort**: Sort products by price (lowest to highest and highest to lowest).
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes.
- **Loading States**: Displays loading states while data is being fetched.
